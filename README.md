# Full-Stack-Recommendation

One day, searching for a watch band on Shein, I pondered the differences between expensive and cheap products. Consequently, I wrote code to identify the most crucial factor and generate recommendations:

    - Conducted data collection using web scraping (BeautifulSoup, Regex) from Shein Website.
    - Cleaned and preprocessed data.
    - Employed NLP techniques to extract product materials such as leather, fabric, silicone, etc.
    - Recommend base on price and material (most expensive material with lowest price)
    - Developed a web app to write search products and see recommended products
